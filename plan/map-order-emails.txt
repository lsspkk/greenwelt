MAP ORDER EMAILS SYSTEM
================================================================================


================================================================================
1. OVERVIEW
================================================================================

When the player is on the map screen, order emails arrive from customers.
Each order contains:
- Customer name (location name from map)
- Plant requests with amounts
- Time when the order notification is to be shown (send_time)

The player must:
1. See the incoming order notification (phone icon with alert)
2. Open phone and read the order
3. Accept the order before it expires
4. Pick up plants from Kasvikauppa (plant shop)
5. Deliver to the customer location
6. Complete enough orders to finish the map


================================================================================
2. ORDER NOTIFICATION ON MAP
================================================================================

Visual indicator:
- Phone icon with alert badge appears when there are visible incoming orders
- Shows count of unread incoming orders
- Separate phone icon (without alert) always visible for viewing accepted orders

Timing:
- Orders are selected in batches (e.g., 3 at a time)
- Each order in the batch has its own send_time delay before becoming visible
- After batch is processed, a delay before next batch is selected
- Configurable in map config YAML

Time limit:
- Each visible incoming order has a time limit to accept (e.g., 10 seconds)
- Configurable per map in map config YAML
- If not accepted in time, order goes back to available pool
- Timer bar visible on the order in phone view


================================================================================
3. EMAIL TEXT GENERATION
================================================================================

Email text is built from:
- data/order_sentences.yaml (plant and amount sentences)
- map orders JSON (plant names and amounts)

Algorithm:
1. For each plant in the order:
   a. Pick random sentence with sentence_type: "plant"
   b. Replace {order_plant_name} with plant_name_fi
   c. Pick random sentence with sentence_type: "amount"
   d. Replace {order_amount} with the amount number

Example order data:
    {
      "plant_filename": "köynnösvehka-01.png",
      "plant_name_fi": "Köynnösvehka",
      "amount": 2
    }

Example sentences from YAML:
    - sentence_type: plant
      phrase: Haluaisin todella saada {order_plant_name}.
    - sentence_type: amount
      phrase: Tarvitsen {order_amount} kappaletta.

Generated email text:
    "Haluaisin todella saada Köynnösvehka. Tarvitsen 2 kappaletta."

Full email format:
    From: [Customer Name]
    
    [Plant sentence 1] [Amount sentence 1]
    [Plant sentence 2] [Amount sentence 2]
    ...


================================================================================
4. ORDER STATES
================================================================================

Each order goes through these states:

    AVAILABLE   -> Order can be selected for incoming batch
    INCOMING    -> Order is in current batch, waiting for send_time
    VISIBLE     -> Order notification shown, accept timer counting down
    ACCEPTED    -> Player accepted the order
    COMPLETED   -> Order was delivered successfully

State transitions:
    AVAILABLE -> INCOMING    : Selected into batch
    INCOMING  -> VISIBLE     : send_time reached
    VISIBLE   -> AVAILABLE   : Accept timer expired (order lost)
    VISIBLE   -> ACCEPTED    : Player clicked accept
    ACCEPTED  -> COMPLETED   : Delivery completed


================================================================================
5. ORDER DATA STRUCTURE
================================================================================

Orders are stored in a simple dictionary, NOT as ECS entities.
The map screen manages order state directly.

MapOrderManager (plain Python class, not ECS):
    
    # Loaded from JSON
    all_orders: dict[str, list[Order]]  # location_name -> list of orders
    
    # Runtime state
    available_orders: list[Order]       # Can be selected
    incoming_orders: list[Order]        # In batch, waiting for send_time
    visible_orders: list[Order]         # Shown to player, accept timer running
    accepted_orders: list[Order]        # Player accepted, pending delivery
    completed_orders: list[Order]       # Delivered
    
    # Timers
    batch_timer: float                  # Time until next batch selection
    
    # Progress tracking
    orders_completed_count: int
    plants_delivered_count: int

Order (data class):
    order_id: str
    customer_location: str                  # Location name
    customer_email: str                 # From locations JSON
    plants: list[PlantOrder]
    state: OrderState
    send_time: float                    # Delay before becoming visible (from JSON)
    accept_timer: float                 # Countdown once visible (-1 if not visible)
    generated_text: str                 # Cached email text

PlantOrder (data class):
    filename: str
    name_fi: str
    name_en: str
    amount: int


================================================================================
6. PHONE ICONS
================================================================================

Two phone icons on the map screen:

1. INCOMING ORDERS PHONE (with alert)
   - Icon: Phone with red/orange notification badge
   - Visible: Only when there are visible incoming orders
   - Badge shows: Count of visible incoming orders
   - Position: Top-right area of map screen
   - Action: Opens incoming orders list
   - Visual: Subtle pulse animation when new orders arrive

2. ACCEPTED ORDERS PHONE (main phone)
   - Icon: Phone without alert badge
   - Visible: Always
   - Position: Fixed position in UI bar (e.g., top-left or bottom)
   - Action: Opens phone interface with tabs for:
     - Accepted orders list
     - Inventory (plants being carried)
   - Badge: Optional badge showing accepted order count

Icon design:
- Simple phone silhouette
- Clear at 1920x1080 resolution
- Approximately 80x80 pixels
- Contrasting colors for visibility on map

================================================================================
8. SCORE TRACKING
================================================================================

Tracked during map play:

    orders_completed_count: int
    plants_delivered_count: int
    orders_by_customer: dict[str, int]      # For statistics
    plants_by_type: dict[str, int]          # For statistics

When an order is delivered:
1. Order moves to completed_orders
2. Counters update
3. Check if completion requirement met


================================================================================
9. MAP CONFIG AND COMPLETION
================================================================================

Each map has completion requirements in its config YAML.

Example: data/map1_config.yaml

    map_id: map1
    map_name: "Keskusta"
    
    # Order batch timing
    order_batch_size: 3             # How many orders selected per batch
    order_batch_delay: 10.0         # Seconds between batches
    order_accept_time: 15.0         # Seconds to accept before order expires
    
    # Completion requirements (meet ANY of these)
    completion:
      orders_required: 10           # Complete 10 orders to finish
      # OR
      plants_required: 50           # Deliver 50 plants total to finish

When completion requirement is met:
1. Show map complete dialog
2. Update game progress
3. Unlock next map


================================================================================
10. DATA FILES
================================================================================

Required files per map:

    data/map1_orders.json       # Orders by customer location
    data/map1_locations.json    # Map marker positions with emails
    data/map1_roads.json        # Road connections
    data/map1_config.yaml       # Map configuration

Shared files:

    data/order_sentences.yaml   # Sentence templates with placeholders
    data/game.toml              # Global game settings


================================================================================
11. SYSTEMS (SIMPLIFIED)
================================================================================

Only ONE system handles all order logic:

OrderSystem (esper.Processor):
    
    Responsibilities:
    - Update batch timer, select new orders when timer expires
    - Update send_time timers for incoming orders
    - Move orders from INCOMING to VISIBLE when send_time reached
    - Update accept timers for visible orders
    - Move expired visible orders back to AVAILABLE
    - Generate email text when order becomes visible (if not cached)
    - Check map completion requirements

    process(dt):
        1. If incoming_orders and visible_orders are both empty:
           - Decrement batch_timer
           - If batch_timer <= 0: select_next_batch()
        
        2. For each order in incoming_orders:
           - Decrement send_time timer
           - If timer <= 0: move to visible_orders, set accept_timer
        
        3. For each order in visible_orders:
           - Decrement accept_timer
           - If accept_timer <= 0: move back to available_orders
        
        4. Check completion:
           - If orders_completed >= orders_required: trigger map complete
           - OR if plants_delivered >= plants_required: trigger map complete

The MapScreen handles:
    - User input (tapping phone icons, delivery button)
    - Opening phone dialogs
    - Processing accept/delivery actions
    - These are NOT in the system, they're in the screen's event handling


================================================================================
12. ECS USAGE (LIMITED)
================================================================================

ECS is used for game entities that benefit from component composition:

Used for:
- Player entity (Position, Velocity, Sprite, PlayerInput)
- Location markers (Position, LocationData, Sprite, Clickable)
- Future: NPCs at locations (Position, NPCData, Animation)

NOT used for:
- Orders (managed by MapOrderManager, plain Python class)
- Score tracking (plain data in MapOrderManager)
- UI state (managed by screens directly)

This keeps the order system simple and avoids over-engineering.


================================================================================
13. CORRECTIONS SUMMARY
================================================================================

Issues found and fixed in this plan revision:

1. ORDER STATES - Fixed inconsistency
   - Old: INCOMING state was confusing (used for both "in batch" and "visible")
   - New: Clear separation: INCOMING (in batch, not yet visible) and 
          VISIBLE (shown to player, accept timer running)

2. SYSTEMS - Dramatically simplified
   - Old: 4 separate systems (OrderDispatchSystem, OrderTimerSystem, 
          OrderTextGeneratorSystem, MapCompletionSystem)
   - New: Single OrderSystem handles all order logic
   - Reason: Orders are tightly coupled, splitting into systems adds 
             complexity without benefit

3. ECS USAGE - Clarified scope
   - Old: Plan implied orders might be ECS entities
   - New: Orders are plain Python data managed by MapOrderManager
   - ECS is only for game entities (player, locations, NPCs)
   - Reason: Orders don't need component composition, they have fixed structure

4. TIME TRACKING - Fixed confusing terminology
   - Old: time_to_show and time_to_hide were confusing (-1 meant different things)
   - New: send_time (delay until visible) and accept_timer (countdown when visible)
   - Simpler mental model

5. DATA STRUCTURE - Added missing customer_email
   - Orders need customer_email for the phone view
   - This comes from map1_locations.json, matched by location name

6. ADDED: Phone icons section (section 6)
   - Two distinct phone icons with clear purposes
   - Visibility rules and actions

7. ADDED: Screens and UI components section (section 7)
   - All screens needed for the order system
   - Layout descriptions for each screen
   - UI component details

8. REMOVED: Overly complex timer logic
   - Old: time_to_select_incoming_orders with complex -1 logic
   - New: Simple batch_timer that counts down

9. PLANT SHOP - Added dialog description
   - Clarified how player picks up plants at Kasvikauppa
   - Based on accepted orders

10. PARTIAL DELIVERY - Simplified
    - Old: Implied complex partial delivery tracking
    - New: Player delivers what they have, order completes when fully delivered
